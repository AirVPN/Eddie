Eddie is developed by and is the official client of [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org), a VPN service based on OpenVPN and operated by activists and hacktivists in defence of net neutrality, privacy and against censorship.

Currently release 2.x supports only AirVPN authentication and servers. Support of other VPN providers exists but is still under beta-stage.

### Tech

Eddie is written in C# with .Net/Mono framework. The macOS edition uses Xamarin.Mac. It is bundled with precompiled binary versions of OpenVPN, stunnel, plink/ssh and other tools for many platforms and architectures. If you don't want them, simply remove them and Eddie will locate it in your file system, or provide custom paths.

To compile from sources, follow this [this guide](https://airvpn.org/topic/12760-how-can-i-compile-the-source-code/).
